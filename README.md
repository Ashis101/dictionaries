### Dictionaries

This repository contains custom made dictionariy used to directories/files enumeration when attacking web applications.

### Starter(s) dictionaries

`starter_2.txt` contains entries with up to two `/` characters in path

`starter_3.txt` contains entries with up to three `/` characters in path (eg. `/path/to/something`), which means it's not that likely to find such path on the server.

`starter_4.txt` contains paths with up to four `/` characters and `starter.txt` is the main one used to create all other, and contains all entries (~79k paths)
